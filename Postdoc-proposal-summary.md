#Project summary  
##Research overview	
Understanding the spatial and temporal scales that are relevant to organisms will provide a better guide for the spatial and temporal scale a study needs to identify mechanisms affecting species richness and abundance for those taxa.  It may also be possible to identify a general pattern for how space and time relationships change with taxa, and relative to the life-history traits of organisms.

##Intellectual 
Different ecological mechanisms operate at different scales, and thus the scale at which a study is conducted is central to understanding those mechanisms.  While ecology has addressed the problems of spatial scale for some time now, it has been only recently that the data have become available to address the problem of temporal scale, although space-for-time substitutions are fairly common.  Because temporal scale ecology is still in its infancy, the problem of synthesizing the relationship between space and scale has not yet been thoroughly addressed, but is central to understanding over which scales space-for-time substitutions are effective, and the relative importance of space and time in identifying pattern generating ecological mechanisms.

##Broader impacts
Remote scientific collaborations have been a way to facilitate participation by under-represented groups for a long time ( for example, women corresponding with male scientists through letters, only using their first initial).  Having a better framework to guide remote collaboration and participation can increase participation for scientists with disability/chronic illness, scientists from primarily undergraduate institutions, and scientists who lack the means to travel.  One category of under-representation that is frequently overlooked is scientists who are facing short or long-term disability due to health conditions, either mental or physical.
 
A lack of familiarity with disability/chronic illness means that accessibility accommodations tend to be post-hoc, and cause the vast majority of current efforts to provide accessibility to chronically ill/disabled scientists to be inadequate or non-existent. I have been active in bringing awareness to both the problems associated with being a scientist with disability/chronic illness as well as providing solutions to include scientists with disabilities/chronic illness through blog posts and social media, and I will continue those efforts while working to broaden participation for other under-represented groups as well.  

I will increase accessibility for scientists by working with Data Carpentry to provide remote access to Data Carpentry workshops. Remote access will allow scientists who need to attend remotely to be able to attend and learn skills that provide a more efficient workflow as well as facilitating remote research and collaboration.  These skills can make it possible/easier for a chronically ill researcher to remain an active scientist, as well as supporting scientists who are financially unable to travel, or who have other responsibilities that prevent them from traveling.  

I will also work/ continue working to start and propose initiatives for an Ecological Society of America Inclusive Ecology section. which will provide an intersectional group to encompass all under-represented groups in ecology.  The Inclusive Ecology section will form alliances with other Ecological Society of American sections, create training materials, and provide workshops and mentoring programs to address systemic inequalities in ecology and improve retention and provide support for under-represented groups in ecology.<!-- This may need to move down, and the other broader impacts section may need to move up.  Either way, the broader impacts needs quite a bit of work and focusing.-->
