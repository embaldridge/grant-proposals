Prepare Project Summary (also called Abstract) of Proposed Research and Training. [1 page limit]
 This is an abstract of the proposed research and training. You must
clearly address and identify in separate statements using the three boxes:(1) an overview of the project;(2) the intellectual merit of the proposed activity; and (3) the broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity or the application will be returned without review.
For all areas, list your sponsoring scientist(s) and institution(s) in the overview.

#Project summary  
##Research overview	
Understanding the spatial and temporal scales that are relevant to organisms will provide a better guide for the spatial and temporal scale a study needs to identify mechanisms affecting species richness and abundance for those taxa.  It may also be possible to identify a general pattern for how space and time relationships change with taxa, and relative to the life-history traits of organisms.

##Intellectual Merit
Different ecological mechanisms operate at different scales, and thus the scale at which a study is conducted is central to understanding those mechanisms [@citation].  While ecology has addressed the problems of spatial scale for some time now, it has been only recently that the data have become available to address the problem of temporal scale, although space-for-time substitutions are fairly common.  Because temporal scale ecology is still in its infancy, the problem of synthesizing the relationship between space and scale has not yet been thoroughly addressed, but is central to understanding over which scales space-for-time substitutions are effective, and the relative importance of space and time in identifying pattern generating ecological mechanisms.

##Broader impacts
Remote work and collaboration is a powerful tool for under-represented groups to gain access to the scientific process.  However, new tools that aid in remote collaboration are not yet widely used or understood in ecology.  I will develop **1)** a framework for remote collaboration, **2)** an accessible online curriculum/training program for learning to use the available tools and technology that faciliate remote working, **3)** my workflow will provide an exemplar for using the available tools and technology to make research and research products as open and accessible as possible, both by following open science principles, and also following disability accessibility guidelines (i.e., providing close-captioning, handouts, and live-streaming for talks, making figures color-blindness interpretable).  Code, data, and publications will be fully open access through tools like GitHub and figshare, and I will communicate ways to make science more accessible and improve a remote workflow to scientists and the general public through social media such as Twitter and blog posts.
