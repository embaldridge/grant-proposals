<!--Prepare Project Summary (also called Abstract) of Proposed Research and Training. [1 page limit] This is an abstract of the proposed research and training. You must clearly address and identify in separate statements using the three boxes:(1) an overview of the project;(2) the intellectual merit of the proposed activity; and (3) the broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity or the application will be returned without review. For all areas, list your sponsoring scientist(s) and institution(s) in the overview.-->
**Research overview**
<!--Needs complete rewrite-->  	
Ecological theory (metapopulation theory, neutral theory, etc.) has been developed using relative scales (e.g. local vs. regional, demographic rates).  While theory is developed in relative scale for greater generality across taxa, conservation planning and research studies need to operate on absolute scales (square kilometers, seasons, years).  I will use a highly computational, data-intensive approach to **1)** compile a database to facilitate **2)** exploration and derivation of a relationship for unifying absolute and relative scales across taxa and **3)** determining the scales at which space-for-time substitutions (observations across space are a reasonable proxy for changes likely to occur over time) are appropriate.  Timoth√©e Poisot (University of Montreal) is an ideal mentor for his expertise in scientific programming and working with large spatial and temporal datasets. James O'Dwyer (University of Illinois) is an ideal mentor for his highly quantitative theoretical approach to ecology.  Both sponsors are conversant with the technology needed and supportive of accommodating my need to work remotely.

**Intellectual Merit** 
<!--Needs complete rewrite-->   
This project combines ecoinformatics and computational ecology across the tree of life (e.g. macrobes and microbes) to **1)** provide a mechanism for linking relative scale-based ecological theory with absolute scale driven empirical and applied ecology by creating a synthesis between relative and absolute scales of space and time and **2)** address a major gap in our understanding of the application of space-for-time substitutions.  Developing this synthesis of relative and absolute scales across taxa will be of broad interest to theoreticians, empiricists, and applied researchers alike.

**Broadening participation of underrepresented groups**  
My research will make use of, develop, and provide tools/methods to broaden participation for persons with chronic illness/disability by addressing structural inequalities, the main barrier to participation by a population that is/has been frequently overlooked as an under-represented group. I will **1)** reduce structural inequalities/barriers through education and **2)** broaden participation through tools and technology.

I will achieve these goals by **1)** educating people about improving access for people with chronic illness/disability through partnering with Ecological Society of America Early Career, Open Science, and Inclusive Ecology sections, **2)** partnering with the Data & Software Carpentry organizations to develop remote options for teaching and learning to use those tools, and **3)**  serving as an online mentor for K-12 students with a disability/chronic illness through the AccessSTEM DO-IT program at the University of Washington. <!--Open science is also a powerful tool for increasing the accessibility of science for many different underrepresented groups, not only chronically ill/disabled researchers, and all of my research products, including data, code, publications and presentations, as well as project development and this proposal will be fully open.-->
