##Project summary  
**Research overview**
<!--Needs complete rewrite-->  	
Ecological theory (metapopulation theory, neutral theory, etc.) has been developed using relative scales (e.g. local vs. regional, demographic rates).  While theory is developed in relative scale for greater generality across taxa, conservation planning and research studies need to operate on absolute scales (square kilometers, seasons, years).  My overarching research goal is to use a highly computational, data-intensive approach to  **1)** apply ecoinformatics tools and techniques to compile a database to allow me to explore the relationship between absolute and relative scale across taxa and provide a framework for future ecological studies by **2)** derive a model for unifying absolute and relative scale across taxa and **3)** determining the scales at which space-for-time substitutions are appropriate.  Timoth√©e Poisot (University of Montreal) is an ideal mentor for his expertise in scientific programming and working with large spatial and temporal datasets. James O'Dwyer (University of Illinois) is an ideal mentor for his highly quantitative theoretical approach to ecology.  Both sponsors are conversant with the technology needed and supportive of accommodating my need to work remotely.

**Intellectual Merit** 
<!--Needs complete rewrite-->   
Different ecological mechanisms operate at different scales, and thus the scale at which a study is conducted is central to understanding those mechanisms [@levin1992problem].  The realm of ecological theory has tended to operate in terms of relative scale, while applied ecology requires absolute scale. <!--Nee This project combines ecoinformatics and computational ecology across the tree of life (e.g. macrobes and microbes) to create a synthesis between relative and absolute scales of space and time.

**Broader impacts**  
My research will make use of, develop, and provide tools and methods to broaden participation to persons with chronic illness or disability, a population that is/has been frequently overlooked as an under-represented group. I will seek to improve access to through **1)** reducing structural inequalities/barriers through education and **2** broadening participation through tools and technology.

I will achieve these goals by **1)** educating faculty and scientists about improving access and accommodations for people with chronic illness/disability through partnering with the Ecological Society of America Early Career, Open Science, and Inclusive Ecology sections, **2)** partnering with the Data & Software Carpentry organizations to develop remote options for teaching and learning to use those tools, and **3**  serving as an online mentor for K-12 students with a disability/chronic illness interested in pursuing a career in science through the AccessSTEM DO-IT program at the University of Washington. Open science is also a powerful tool for increasing the accessibility of science for many different underrepresented groups, not only chronically ill/disabled researchers, and all of my research products, including data, code, publications and presentations, as well as project development and this proposal will be fully open.
