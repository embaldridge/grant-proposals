#Project description
##Intro
<!--1) a brief and informative introduction or background section--> 
The scale over which an organism operates is central to understanding the processes that structure an assemblage or an ecological community.  The influence of ecological processes changes with scale.  
  
<!--Put in figure-->
  
This project will also demonstrate the utility and viability of fully remote, reproducible scientific collaboration using computational and ecoinformatics approaches.

##Research objectives, methods, and significance
<!--2) a statement of research objectives, methods, and significance-->


###Objective 1
Determine which spatial and temporal scales are organismally relevant.  

###Objective 2 
Identify the scales over which space-for-time substitutions can be made. 


###Objective 3
Identify strengths of ecological processes at different spatial and temporal scales.

<!--###Objective 4
Identify how life history/functional traits (like body size, but also things like trophic level, storage effect related traits help partition the spatial and temporal scales that are organismally relevant.-->

##Methods
Geographic ranges- migratory vs. non-migratory species.  


###Data
Pre-existing datasets.
Retriever

Compiled data from the literature.
Need for additional database.  Database of vertebrate home ranges contains a relatively small subset of vertebrate diversity.  I will compile additional home range data from the literature.  

###Analysis
Completely reproducible.  Command line Retriever | Extract and process data with postgres in Python | Analysis in R| Output results & graph

<!--R seems to have some good packages already, and reinventing the wheel is probably a bad idea.-->

##Training objectives  
Training in ecological software development and spatial and temporal analytical techniques will complement and increase my current skill set and areas of expertise.  My doctoral research focused on using ecoinformatics and maximum likelihood methods with Python programming to test competing models of species abundance distributions.  I have limited experience with spatial and temporal analysis or programming in R, the primary statistical programming language used by ecologists.  This project would give me strong training in temporal and spatial analysis, experience in developing software in a programming language (R) that will make it easier for me to collaborate with other ecologists in future, and develop connections with colleagues in working with programming, statistics, and community ecology.  I will receive training in these skills through textbooks, computational resources, and mentoring.     


##Future directions/career development
<!--3) training objectives and plan for achieving them (these may include scientific as well as other career preparation activities)-->

Independent researcher  

Despite challenges of chronic illness, I am able to remain an active researcher through a series of coping mechanisms.  Besides contributing to the scientific process through research, I have been working and will continue to work to increase accessibility and awareness for chronically ill/disabled ecologists and ecologists from other under-represented groups. 

#Career development
<!--4) an explanation of how the fellowship activities will enhance your career development and future research directions as well as describing how this research differs from your dissertation research-->

The combination of computational, ecoinformatics, and quantitative skills is  a rare skill set among ecologists, and one that is particularly well suited to working remotely.  Developing these skills further while engaging in remote collaborations with scientists at other institutions will provide a clear demonstration that telecommuting and remote collaboration should be a more accepted method for employment in the sciences, much as it is in the computer/tech fields.  This paradigm shift supports not only scientists with disabilities/chronic illness, but also scientists who do not have the funds for travel, or who are caretakers of small children or other family members.  In addition, developing these skills also provides a way for me to continue doing science without formal institutional support if necessary.  
 

##Justification of sponsor(s) and host institution(s)
<!--5) a justification of the choice of sponsoring scientist(s) and host institution(s)-->
<!-- Description of awesome people with the skills and ideas that I want to work with-->
*Timoth√©e Poisot (University of Montreal)-computational ecology
Poisot's research interests and skills make him an ideas sponsor for both the intellectual development and implementation of this project as well as an excellent mentor for developing and refining the computational skills that are an essential component of my training objectives.  **Poisot** is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences and is a member of the Quebec Centre for Biodiversity Science.  He is a strong advocate for open and reproducible science and his lab is heavily involved in creating well designed software for ecological analyses.  In additional to Poisot's computational expertise that will facilitate remote mentorship, the University of Montreal has extensive remotely accessible computational resources and offers webinar training for using the high-performance computing resources.


<!--Final paragraph-->Due to my physical limitations, I will not be able to be physically present at the host institutions; however, I will be able to interact with colleagues on-site through a remote presence via a Kubi teleconferencing robot (https://www.revolverobotics.com/), which will allow me to have control over my movement on site, leading to more natural interactions.  Additionally, all the sponsoring scientists are well-versed in the computational tools and workflow that make it possible for me to effectively collaborate with others remotely.

##Broader impacts
<!--7)a separate section within the narrative, a discussion of the broader impacts of the proposed activities.-->
<!--Inadequacy of current efforts to include chronically ill researchers.-->
###Overview
Working to improve opportunities and address structural inequalities to broaden participation for under-represented groups is, unfortunately part of being a member of an under-represented group.  Having to self-advocate to improve structural inequalities and to obtain access as a member of an under-represented group (in my case, a scientist with a chronic illness) robs researchers of valuable and limited time and energy that they could use to be actually doing science.One category of under-representation that is frequently overlooked is scientists who are facing short or long-term disability due to health conditions, either mental or physical.
 
A lack of familiarity with disability/chronic illness means that accessibility accommodations tend to be post-hoc, and cause the vast majority of current efforts to provide accessibility to chronically ill/disabled scientists to be inadequate or non-existent. I have been active in bringing awareness to both the problems associated with being a scientist with disability/chronic illness as well as providing solutions to include scientists with disabilities/chronic illness through blog posts and social media. 
 <!--A chronically ill researcher is working with less energy, and less physical capacity than an able bodied scientist.  While dealing with a failing body, a scientist should not also have to fight the numerous institutional barriers to remaining an active participant in science.-->    
Chronic illness is only one of the many under-represented groups in science, and many scientists belong to more than one category of under-represented group.  A more inclusive approach to broadening participation of under-represented groups is taking an intersectional approach to under-representation.  I propose to use currently existing tools and technology to improve access for many categories of under-represented group through creating a framework for remote access tools for collaboration as well as remote options for learning to use those tools.  

Remote scientific collaborations have been a way to facilitate participation by under-represented groups for a long time ( for example, women corresponding with male scientists through letters, only using their first initial).  Having a better framework to guide remote collaboration and participation can increase participation for scientists with disability/chronic illness, scientists from primarily undergraduate institutions, and scientists who lack the means to travel.  

###Broadening participation through tools and technology
Open science is also a powerful tool for increasing the accessibility of science for many different underrepresented groups, not only chronically ill/disabled researchers.  For example, people at primarily undergraduate institutions or who are unaffiliated with an institution often lack access to the funding and resources that larger institutions have.  An open approach to science allows access and sharing of educational tools and lessons, data, and papers that would be difficult or impossible to acquire otherwise.  Remote work, combined with open science approaches helps to equalize the conditions for primarily undergraduate institutions and researchers doing computational work, allowing them to remain more competitive with researchers at larger institutions, as well as create opportunities for communicating science to under-represented groups at the K-12 levels through developing lessons and outreach tools.

<!--Plan for teaching these skills.-->
Computational tools and techniques becoming increasingly more important in science, and having the opportunity to learn these skills has, so far, been primarily restricted to in-person workshops, classes, or events at larger institutions.  At my urging, both the Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry organizations plan to develop and provide remote accessibility to workshops, as well as making certain that disability accessibility for workshops are an essential part of workshop planning and available accommodations are included in workshop announcements.  Having remote accessibility means that scientists who are unable to travel due to financial, physical, or other limitations can still participate in learning the tools that they need to collaborate and remain competitive.  Remote options also allow scientists who cannot travel to participate in sharing their skills, and train the next generation of scientists.

   


<!--Tools that a chronically ill researcher can use to remain active in the field. -->
As a chronically ill researcher, I have found that computational tools have been invaluable in allowing me to continue working as an active researcher.  Not only do these skills make remote collaboration much easier/possible, these tools also make executing research much easier.  I will also become involved with the AccessSTEM DO-IT (Disabilities, Opportunities, Internetworking, and Technology) program at the University of Washington as a mentor for disabled K-12 students.




I have also been active in disclosing my illness and trying to raise awareness about chronically ill/disabled researchers.
