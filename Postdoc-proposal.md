Prepare Project Summary (also called Abstract) of Proposed Research and Training. [1 page limit]
 This is an abstract of the proposed research and training. You must
clearly address and identify in separate statements using the three boxes:(1) an overview of the project;(2) the intellectual merit of the proposed activity; and (3) the broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity or the application will be returned without review.
For all areas, list your sponsoring scientist(s) and institution(s) in the overview.

#Project summary
##Research overview
The ultimate goal of my research is to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms that produce commonness and rarity in
an ecological context. First, I will explore the evolutionary basis of commonness and rarity by determining if commonness and rarity are
phylogenetically heritable. Second, I will identify if regional occupancy and abundance can be explained by life history traits.

##Intellectual 
While the hollow curve species abundance distribution is a ubiquitious macroecological pattern, attempting to identify mechanisms of commonness and rarity through model fitting has been unsuccessful.  Recent research suggests that examining crucial constraints that produce the pattern is a more effective approach to identify mechanism.  <!--Something about S and N and interesting which species are likely to be more abundant, conservation, utility of trait based approaches + phylogeny over multiple taxa. -->

##Broader impacts
A lack of familiarity with disability/chronic illness means that accessibility accommodations tend to be post-hoc, and cause the vast majority of current efforts to provide accessibility to chronically ill/disabled scientists to be inadequate or non-existent. nce and participation a trivial exercise.  I have been trying to develop strategies to bring awareness to both the problems associated with being a scientist with disability/chronic illness as well as providing solutions to include scientists with disabilities/chronic illness. I am a computational macroecologist who is disabled by chronic illness.  My research uses publicly available data and computational methods, allowing me to continue to be an active researcher without funding or an institutional affliation.  I will increase accessibility for scientists by working with Data Carpentry to provide remote access to Data Carpentry workshops. Remote access will allow scientists who need to attend remotely to be able to attend and learn skills that provide a more efficient workflow as well as facilitating remote research and collaboration.  These skills can make it possible/easier for a chronically ill researcher to remain an active scientist.

Prepare Project Description (Research and Training Plan).[6 page limit,
including all figures, tables, etc.] 
The research and training plan presents the research that you will conduct and the training that you will receive during the fellowship period and how they relate to your career goals. Include in the research and training plan: 1) a brief and informative introduction or background section; 2) a statement of research objectives, methods, and
significance; 3) training objectives and plan for achieving them (these may include scientific as well as other career preparation activities); 4) an explanation of how the fellowship activities will enhance your career development and future research directions as well as describing how this research differs from your dissertation research; 5) a justification of the choice of sponsoring scientist(s) and host institution(s); 6) a timetable with yearly goals with benchmarks for major anticipated outcomes; 7)a separate section within the narrative, a discussion of the broader impacts of the proposed activities.

##Intro

##Research objectives, methods, and significance
##Future directions/career development
Independent researcher  
I have a chronic illness which limits my ability to pursue the traditional academic career path, or the traditional non-academic career path.  Travel to conferences or workshops is no longer an option, I frequently don't leave my property for weeks/months, had to surrender driver's license, have periods of serious cognitive dysfunction, periods where I am reliant on a cane.  <!-- I really don't know how much to disclose.  My inclination is to gloss over it personally, but I think from a cultural changing perspective that it could be valuable to fully disclose to indicate that I've got some really significant problems but am still doing research anyway -->  I've set up my workspace at home, and have finished up my dissertation working remotely in a different timezone from my advisor.  

Career development
Computational ecology skills, combined with data wrangling skills and open access data provide a way for me to continue doing science without institutional support.  Working with Data and Software Carpentry to help spread the skills gives me a larger pool of potential collaborators, plus it allows me to be able to teach.


##Justification of sponsor(s) and host institution(s)

##Goals and benchmarks
I think I got the data wrangling bit done.

Need to learn phylogenetic analysis

Write more scripts, do things.

Maybe learn more spatial analysis techniques.

##Broader impacts
<!--Inadequacy of current efforts to include chronically ill researchers.-->
A chronically ill researcher is working with less energy, and less physical capacity than an able bodied scientist.  While dealing with a failing body, a scientist should not also have to fight the numerous institutional barriers to remaining an active participant in science.  Having to self-advocate for access robs the researchers of valuable and limited time and energy that he/she could use to be actually doing science.  Many workshops/conferences lack any accessibility information, and the accessibility information that is available is often restricted to the more traditionally visible disability (vision/hearing impairment, mobility restrictions) and buried on the organizational website, rather than being provided in the announcement.  Providing remote access/attendance is a way that chronically ill/ disabled scientists can attend workshops and conferences that allow them to remain current on cutting edge research and techniques in their field.


<!--Tools that a chronically ill researcher can use to remain active in the field. -->
As a chronically ill researcher, I have found that computational tools have been invaluable in allowing me to continue working as an active researcher.  Not only do these skills make remote collaboration much easier/possible, these tools also make executing research much easier.  
Version control
Programming
Database skills


<!--Plan for teaching these skills.-->
I have been working with Ethan White with Data Carpentry to provide remote accessibility to workshops, as well as making certain that disability accessibility for workshops are part of the announcement.

I have also written a simple Python script to generate a sample disability accessibility statement for workshops/conferences.

I have also been active in disclosing my illness and trying to raise awareness about chronically ill/disabled researchers.
