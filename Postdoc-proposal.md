#Project summary
##Research overview
The ultimate goal of my research is to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms that produce commonness and rarity in
an ecological context. First, I will explore the evolutionary basis of commonness and rarity by determining if commonness and rarity are
phylogenetically heritable. Second, I will identify if regional occupancy and abundance can be explained by life history traits. <!--Or: Understanding the spatial and temporal scales that are relevant to organisms could provide a better guide for the spatial and temporal scale a study needs to identify mechanisms affecting species richness and abundance for those taxa.  It may also be possible to identify a general pattern for how space and time relationships change with taxa.-->

##Intellectual 
While the hollow curve species abundance distribution is a ubiquitious macroecological pattern, attempting to identify mechanisms of commonness and rarity through model fitting has been unsuccessful.  Recent research suggests that examining crucial constraints that produce the pattern is a more effective approach to identify mechanism.  <!--Something about S and N and interesting which species are likely to be more abundant, conservation, utility of trait based approaches + phylogeny over multiple taxa. --> <!--Different ecological mechanisms operate at different scales, and thus the scale at which a study is conducted is central to understanding those mechanisms.  While ecology has addressed the problems of spatial scale for some time now, it has been only recently that the data have become available to address the problem of temporal scale, although space-for-time substitutions are fairly common.  Because temporal scale ecology is still in its infancy, the problem of synthesizing the relationship between space and scale has not yet been thoroughly addressed, but is central to understanding over which scales space-for-time substitutions are effective, and the relative importance of space and time in identifying pattern generating ecological mechanisms.-->

##Broader impacts
A lack of familiarity with disability/chronic illness means that accessibility accommodations tend to be post-hoc, and cause the vast majority of current efforts to provide accessibility to chronically ill/disabled scientists to be inadequate or non-existent. I have been active in bringing awareness to both the problems associated with being a scientist with disability/chronic illness as well as providing solutions to include scientists with disabilities/chronic illness through blog posts and social media, and I will continue those efforts.  

I will increase accessibility for scientists by working with Data Carpentry to provide remote access to Data Carpentry workshops. Remote access will allow scientists who need to attend remotely to be able to attend and learn skills that provide a more efficient workflow as well as facilitating remote research and collaboration.  These skills can make it possible/easier for a chronically ill researcher to remain an active scientist, as well as supporting scientists who are financially unable to travel, or who have other responsiblities that prevent them from traveling.  

I will also work/ continue working to start and propose inititives for an Ecological Society of America Inclusive Ecology section. which will provide an intersectional group to encompass all under-represented groups in ecology.  The Inclusive Ecology section will form alliances with other Ecological Society of American sections, create training materials, and provide workshops and mentoring programs to address systemic inequalities in ecology and improve retention and provide support for under-represented groups in ecology.<!-- This may need to move down, and the other broader impacts section may need to move up.  Either way, the broader impacts needs quite a bit of work and focusing.-->

<!--3) training objectives and plan for achieving them (these may include scientific as well as other career preparation activities)-->

Independent researcher  
I have a chronic illness which has seriously impacted my ability to function in the traditional academic environment.  Travel to conferences or workshops is extremely challenging, and for the majority of events, no longer an option due to the severe health consequences that  remain as the aftereffects of travel for several weeks afterwards.  My condition has caused periods of cognitive dysfunction related to information processing and comprehension as well as periods of reliance on mobility assistance devices.  

Despite these challenges, I am able to remain an active researcher through a series of coping mechanism.  Besides contributing to the scientific process through research, I have been working and will continue to work to increase accessibility and awareness for chronically ill/disabled ecologists and ecologists from other under-represented groups. 

#Career development
<!--4) an explanation of how the fellowship activities will enhance your career development and future research directions as well as describing how this research differs from your dissertation research-->

The combination of computational, ecoinformatics, and quantitative skills is  a rare skill set among ecologists, and one that is particularly well suited to working remotely.  Developing these skills further while engaging in remote collaborations with scientists at other institutions will provide a clear demonstration that telecommuting and remote collaboration should be a more accepted method for employment in the sciences, much as it is in the computer/tech fields.  This paradigm shift supports not only scientists with disabilities/chronic illness, but also scientists who do not have the funds for travel, or who are caretakers of small children or other family members.  In addition, developing these skills also provides a way for me to continue doing science without formal institutional support if neccessary.  
 

##Justification of sponsor(s) and host institution(s)
<!--5) a justification of the choice of sponsoring scientist(s) and host institution(s)-->
<!-- Description of awesome people with the skills and ideas that I want to work with-->

Due to my physical limitations, I will not be able to be physically present at the host institutions; however, I will be able to interact with colleagues on-site through a remote prescence via a Kubi teleconferencing robot (https://www.revolverobotics.com/), which will allow me to have control over my movement on site, leading to more natural interactions.  Additionally, all the sponsoring scientists are comfortable with the computational tools and workflow that make it possible for me to effectively collaborate with others remotely.   
##Goals and benchmarks
<!--6) a timetable with yearly goals with benchmarks for major anticipated outcomes; -->

<!--Need to learn phylogenetic analysis-->

Write more scripts, do things.

Learn more spatial analysis techniques.

Learn temporal analysis techniques.

I want to continue to improve my scientific programming skills.

###Summary
Working to improve opportunities and address structural inequalites to broaden participation for under-represented groups is, unfortunately part of being a member of an under-represented group.  Having to self-advocate to improve structural inequalities and to obtain access as a member of an under-represented group (in my case, a scientist with a chronic illness) robs researchers of valuable and limited time and energy that they could use to be actually doing science. <!--A chronically ill researcher is working with less energy, and less physical capacity than an able bodied scientist.  While dealing with a failing body, a scientist should not also have to fight the numerous institutional barriers to remaining an active participant in science.-->    However, chronic illness is only one of the many under-represented groups in science, and many scientists belong to more than one category of under-represented group.  A more inclusive approach to addressing the problem of under-representation is taking an intersectional approach to under-representation, where people can advocate to improve conditions for all under-represented groups across categories.

To this end, I have drafted by-laws and collected signatures to start an Inclusive Ecology section as part of the Ecological Society of America, which has been submitted to the governing board for consideration.  This section will be involved in working to provide better support to under-represented ecologists, starting with improving the conference experience for all ecologists, starting with accessibility and accommodations for chronically ill/disabled ecologists and providing training to volunteers, moderators, and staff on respecting gender identity and expression.

<!--Open science is also a powerful tool for increasing the accessibility of science for underrepresented groups.--> People at primarily undergraduate instiutions or who are unaffiliated with an instution often lack access to the funding and resources that larger instituions have.  An open approach to science allows access and sharing of educational tools and lessons, data, and papers that would be difficult or impossible to acquire otherwise.  Remote work, combined with open science approaches helps to equalize the conditions for primarily undergraduate institutions and researchers doing computational work, allowing them to remain more competative with researchers at larger institutions.    


<!--Tools that a chronically ill researcher can use to remain active in the field. -->
As a chronically ill researcher, I have found that computational tools have been invaluable in allowing me to continue working as an active researcher.  Not only do these skills make remote collaboration much easier/possible, these tools also make executing research much easier.   
Version control  
Programming  
Database skills  


<!--Plan for teaching these skills.-->
I have been working with Ethan White with Data Carpentry to provide remote accessibility to workshops, as well as making certain that disability accessibility for workshops are part of the announcement.

I have also written a simple Python script to generate a sample disability accessibility statement for workshops/conferences, which I will turn into an interactive component of the Inclusive Ecology section website.

I have also been active in disclosing my illness and trying to raise awareness about chronically ill/disabled researchers.

Starting a section.

<!--Biographical Sketch[2 page limit]
Submit your CV in the section Biographical Sketches. Follow the form
given in the Grants Program Guide II.C.2.f.i for senior personnel. List conference abstracts and titles of presentations separate from peer-reviewed articles. For unpublished manuscripts, list only those submitted or accepted for publication (along with most likely date of publication).-->
#Biosketch
I am a computational macroecologist who is disabled by chronic illness.  My research uses publicly available data and computational methods, allowing me to continue to be an active researcher without funding or an institutional affliation.
<!--Data Management Plan:
All applications must include a supplementary document of no more than two pages labeled "Data Management Plan". Describe plans for data management and sharing of the products of research, or assert the absence of the need for such plans. Upload this to Supplementary Documents–Data Management Plan.-->
#Data management plan
###Research products reuse and redistribution
All research products, including code, data, presentations/posters, and publications will be open access and freely available for reuse without request during all stages of development under a Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license, following the Panton Principles guidelines (http://pantonprinciples.org).  This license dedicates the research products to the public domain without restriction, allowing for maximum reusability.


###Code
Research products (code) will be available on a publicly available, open access GitHub repository (http://github.com/embaldridge), and GitHub issues and wiki will be used as an online lab notebook.  The version of code used in final publication will be archived through Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/).

###Data
The majority of the data that I will use is publicly available data, so a data management plan (for data) is not necessary for those datasets.  However, any scripts written to extract and process the data will be available in the code repository to make the data extraction pro cess fully reproducible, as long as a researcher has access to the datasets.

No new data will be collected; but additional data may be compiled from the literature.  Any additional database compilations will be initially compiled openly on GitHub, and versions of the database used for analysis will be archived on figshare prior to ultimate publication in *Ecological Archives* as a data paper, which archives the data and allows the data to be freely accessed.  I will write script to make these data, and any other publicly available datasets that I use, directly importable through the EcoData Retriever(www.ecodataretriever.org).  The EcoData Retriever is a tool developed to make the reuse of ecological data simpler and more reproducible [morris2013].

###Presentations/Posters
Presentations and posters about the research will be archived on GitHub (http://github.com/embaldridge/posters-pres) and either figshare (posters) or Slideshare (presentations).  Additionally, a pre-talk transcript will be available on the GitHub repository in advance of the presentation to accommodate neurodivergent  and hearing impaired colleagues.  Ideally, talks will be livestreamed with Google Hangouts on Air or simiilar software to allow for remote participation.  If this is not possible, due to venue or event restrictions, I will record the talk after the fact.  In either event, the video of the talk will then be closed captioned and made publicly available on YouTube.

###Publications
All publications will first be made available as pre-prints through a preprint server such as arXive, bioRxive, or PeerJ.  Final publications will be published in journals that allow for gold open access publication and have rapid review times (e.g., Ecology, PLoS, PeerJ, etc.).

###Roles and responsibilities
Elita Baldridge will be primarily responsible for data collection and management, code development and managment, and dissemination of research products.  Supporting scientists will provide guidance and support in developing, managing, and sharing code.  The reproducible workflow and archiving of research products for this project will provide long-term open-access to data, code,and computational tools both during the term of the grant, and after the grant ends.
