Independent researcher  
I have a chronic illness which has seriously impacted my ability to function in the traditional academic environment.  Travel to conferences or workshops is extremely challenging, and for the majority of events, no longer an option due to the severe health consequences that  remain as the aftereffects of travel for several weeks afterwards.  My condition has caused periods of cognitive dysfunction related to information processing and comprehension as well as periods of reliance on mobility assistance devices.  

Despite these challenges, I am able to remain an active researcher through a series of coping mechanism.  Besides contributing to the scientific process through research, I have been working and will continue to work to increase accessibility and awareness for chronically ill/disabled ecologists and ecologists from other under-represented groups. 

#Career development
<!--4) an explanation of how the fellowship activities will enhance your career development and future research directions as well as describing how this research differs from your dissertation research-->

The combination of computational, ecoinformatics, and quantitative skills is  a rare skill set among ecologists, and one that is particularly well suited to working remotely.  Developing these skills further while engaging in remote collaborations with scientists at other institutions will provide a clear demonstration that telecommuting and remote collaboration should be a more accepted method for employment in the sciences, much as it is in the computer/tech fields.  This paradigm shift supports not only scientists with disabilities/chronic illness, but also scientists who do not have the funds for travel, or who are caretakers of small children or other family members.  In addition, developing these skills also provides a way for me to continue doing science without formal institutional support if necessary.  
 

##Justification of sponsor(s) and host institution(s)
<!--5) a justification of the choice of sponsoring scientist(s) and host institution(s)-->
<!-- Description of awesome people with the skills and ideas that I want to work with-->

Due to my physical limitations, I will not be able to be physically present at the host institutions; however, I will be able to interact with colleagues on-site through a remote presence via a Kubi teleconferencing robot (https://www.revolverobotics.com/), which will allow me to have control over my movement on site, leading to more natural interactions.  Additionally, all the sponsoring scientists are comfortable with the computational tools and workflow that make it possible for me to effectively collaborate with others remotely.   
##Goals and benchmarks
<!--6) a timetable with yearly goals with benchmarks for major anticipated outcomes; -->

<!--Need to learn phylogenetic analysis-->

Write more scripts, do things.

Learn more spatial analysis techniques.

Learn temporal analysis techniques.

I want to continue to improve my scientific programming skills.

###Summary
Working to improve opportunities and address structural inequalities to broaden participation for under-represented groups is, unfortunately part of being a member of an under-represented group.  Having to self-advocate to improve structural inequalities and to obtain access as a member of an under-represented group (in my case, a scientist with a chronic illness) robs researchers of valuable and limited time and energy that they could use to be actually doing science. <!--A chronically ill researcher is working with less energy, and less physical capacity than an able bodied scientist.  While dealing with a failing body, a scientist should not also have to fight the numerous institutional barriers to remaining an active participant in science.-->    However, chronic illness is only one of the many under-represented groups in science, and many scientists belong to more than one category of under-represented group.  A more inclusive approach to addressing the problem of under-representation is taking an intersectional approach to under-representation, where people can advocate to improve conditions for all under-represented groups across categories.
Remote scientific collaborations have been a way to facilitate participation by under-represented groups for a long time ( for example, women corresponding with male scientists through letters, only using their first initial).  Having a better framework to guide remote collaboration and participation can increase participation for scientists with disability/chronic illness, scientists from primarily undergraduate institutions, and scientists who lack the means to travel.  One category of under-representation that is frequently overlooked is scientists who are facing short or long-term disability due to health conditions, either mental or physical.
 
A lack of familiarity with disability/chronic illness means that accessibility accommodations tend to be post-hoc, and cause the vast majority of current efforts to provide accessibility to chronically ill/disabled scientists to be inadequate or non-existent. I have been active in bringing awareness to both the problems associated with being a scientist with disability/chronic illness as well as providing solutions to include scientists with disabilities/chronic illness through blog posts and social media, and I will continue those efforts while working to broaden participation for other under-represented groups as well.  



###Broadening participation through organization
I have drafted by-laws and collected signatures to start an Inclusive Ecology section as part of the Ecological Society of America, which has been submitted to the governing board for consideration.  The Ecological Society of America has an existing program (SEEDS) that seeks to broaden participation from under-represented groups at the undergraduate level.  The Inclusive Ecology section seeks to expand this effort to provide support to all under-represented ecologists after they have completed their undergraduate degree, serving ecologists at all career stages, and working with other sections, such as the Open Science section and the Science Communication section to create a more inclusive environment for all ecologists.  It will provide a grass roots effort for ecologists to change the culture of ecology to be more supportive of members of under-represented groups.

The Inclusive Ecology section will have several initiatives, starting with addressing some challenges faced at the annual meeting to improve accessibility and accommodations for chronically ill/disabled ecologists and providing training to volunteers, moderators, and staff on respecting gender identity and expression.  The Inclusive Ecology section will also develop a mentoring network for ecologists from under-represented groups, and this network will also interface with the Early Career mentoring network as well.  Educational materials for allies and tools aimed at addressing some of the problems faced by members of under-represented groups will be an important  component of the Inclusive Ecology section website.  


###Broadening participation through tools and technology
Open science is also a powerful tool for increasing the accessibility of science for underrepresented groups.  People at primarily undergraduate institutions or who are unaffiliated with an institution often lack access to the funding and resources that larger institutions have.  An open approach to science allows access and sharing of educational tools and lessons, data, and papers that would be difficult or impossible to acquire otherwise.  Remote work, combined with open science approaches helps to equalize the conditions for primarily undergraduate institutions and researchers doing computational work, allowing them to remain more competitive with researchers at larger institutions, as well as create opportunities for communicating science to under-represented groups at the K-12 levels through developing lessons and outreach tools.



<!--Plan for teaching these skills.-->
Computational tools and techniques becoming increasingly more important in science, and having the opportunity to learn these skills has, so far, been primarily restricted to in-person workshops, classes, or events at larger institutions.  I have been working with Ethan White with Data Carpentry to provide remote accessibility to workshops, as well as making certain that disability accessibility for workshops are part of the announcement.  Having remote accessibility means that scientists who are unable to travel due to financial, physical, or other limitations can still participate in learning the tools that they need to collaborate and remain competitive.  Remote options also allow scientists who cannot travel to participate in sharing their skills, and train the next generation of scientists.

   


<!--Tools that a chronically ill researcher can use to remain active in the field. -->
As a chronically ill researcher, I have found that computational tools have been invaluable in allowing me to continue working as an active researcher.  Not only do these skills make remote collaboration much easier/possible, these tools also make executing research much easier.   
Version control  
Programming  
Database skills  





I have also been active in disclosing my illness and trying to raise awareness about chronically ill/disabled researchers.
