**Project description**  
**Introduction**  
A data-driven approach to unifying relative and absolute scales.
<!--1) a brief and informative introduction or background section--> 
A central problem in ecology is the effect of spatial and temporal scales on the study of pattern-generating mechanisms (ecological processes)[@levin1992problem, @chave2013problem].<!--Needs reworking--> However, much of ecological theory (metapopulation theory, neutral theory, etc.) has been developed using relative measures of scale (e.g. local vs. regional, demographic parameters).  While theory is developed in relative scale for greater generality across taxa, conservation planning and research studies need to operate on absolute scales (square kilometers, years), creating a need for a synthesis between relative and absolute scales in ecology.   
  
This project aims to address three major gaps in our ecological understanding of spatial and temporal scale.  I will  **1)**compile an extensive dataset on geographic range size, home range size, etc. that will will allow me to **2)** derive a model for unifying absolute and relative scales [sensu @meentemeyer1989geographical] across taxa and **3)** identify the scales over which space-for-time substitutions can be made.
This project will also demonstrate the utility and viability of fully remote, reproducible scientific collaboration using computational and ecoinformatics approaches.

**Research objectives, methods, and significance**  
<!--2) a statement of research objectives, methods, and significance-->
**Objective 1**  
Compile emergent traits database (home range size, geographic range size, etc.) from the literature, 

**Objective 2**
Derive a model for unifying absolute and relative scales across taxa.  

**Objective 3**  
Identify the scales over which space-for-time substitutions can be made. 

**Methods** 
<!--Needs tightening-->
Data-driven approaches to ecological questions (ecoinformatics) require the use of computationally intensive methods, but have been an increasingly valuable tool for biodiversity/ecological research [@michener2012ecoinformatics].  Ecoinformatics/macroecological approaches use large quantities of ecological data, often aggregated from the literature or from large survey efforts to address ecological questions using a comparative statistical approach [@brown1995macroecology; @kelling2009data], allowing ecologists to address questions at broader spatial or temporal scales and for a greater range of taxa than possible with a traditional field experimental approach.    


**Data**  
While there are challenges of using synthetic and publicly available datasets [see @reichman2011challenges], using a diverse array of publicly available datasets allows ecologists to leverage existing data to answer questions using a comparative approach.



**Analysis** 
<!--While a comparative approach can be a powerful approach for addressing broad ecological questions, the data needed to address these types of questions does not lend itself well to traditional hypothetico-deductive methods [@blackburn2004method].-->  

**Objective 1: Compile emergent traits database.**  
<!--Need to clearly define what traits that I want to use.  A table here would be good--> To unify relative and absolute scale, I will compile a database of emergent species properties (e.g., home range size, geographic range size) that are measured in terms of absolute scale (e.g., square kilometers) but relate to relative scale (e.g. local, regional).  I will compile a single, open access database that addresses the gap in the currently available data.  Providing a central, open access resource for these species parameters will provide a new, valuable resource for macroecological comparisons, which are often constrained due to a lack of centralized, quality controlled data. While there are some pre-existing datasets that provide information on species parameters and life history traits at different spatial and temporal scales, such as dispersal distance, home range sizes, maximum longevity, generation times, and geographic range size [@gargantobase; @pantheria; @dryad_q5j65], the data do not exist in a single database and there is a great deal of information that can be gleaned from the literature to add to the currently available data.  

 
**Objective 2: Derive a model for unifying absolute and relative scales.**    
Deriving a relationship between relative and absolute scale across taxa will provide guidelines for assessing data-deficient species and provide additional information for conservation planning.  <!--[@citations]-->   I will develop an allometric-type scaling relationship for unifying absolute and relative scales, parameterizing the model with the database compiled in objective 1.  Terrestrial vertebrates are a well-studied group with the most complete species-specific data, making those groups (birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians) a good place to begin developing a general relationship between absolute and relative scale with graphical analysis and regression techniques. I will then try to extend the model using additional data from other taxa, and see how far it goes before the model becomes overly complex or non-predictive. <!--Needs refinement, obviously-->

**Objective 3: Identify the scales over which space-for-time substitutions can be made.**     
Space-for-time substitutions are based on the assumption that observing changes through space serves as a reasonable proxy for changes that are likely to occur through time[@pickett1989space]. Although space-for-time substitutions have been used in ecology with varying degrees of efficacy, the scales identified as potentially useful for space-for-time substitutions have been defined in relative terms (i.e., local, regional)([@pickett1989space].<!--Needs transition-here.--> 

I will use spatially and temporally explicit community abundance data from across the tree of life, from large, publicly available datasets including birds [@BBS], plants[@fia], plankton [@plankton], and microbial [@meyer2008metagenomics] dataset, in addition to other smaller publicly available datasets [@MiscDB] and datasets that can be obtained through memoranda of understanding.  Community abundance data will allow me to explore two intraspecific macroecological patterns, the intraspecific occupancy-abundance relationship (time) and the intraspecific                                             abundance-distribution relationship (space).I will use the intra-specific occupancy abundance (time) pattern, and the intra-specific abundance distribution pattern (space), to determine when space-for-time substitutions can be reasonably used, and over what absolute scales, if any, the relationship between space and time is reliable.


**Training objectives and career development**
<!--3) training objectives and plan for achieving them (these may include scientific as well as other career preparation activities)-->    
Training in spatial and temporal analytical techniques and model building/testing will complement my current skill set in ecoinformatics and computational ecology.  I have a strong background in computational ecology and ecoinformatic and macroecological techniques through my doctoral work, which used a data-intensive, maximum likelihood based approach to compare species abundance distribution models. I have limited experience with modelling work and the most current spatial and temporal approaches. This project will give me strong training in cutting edge temporal and spatial analysis, model development and testing, experience in developing and testing software in an additional programming language (R), and further experience in ecoinformatics.  I will receive training in these skills through textbooks, remote training opportunities (webinars, online training/classes, remote attendance), and mentoring.  
<!--4) an explanation of how the fellowship activities will enhance your career development and future research directions as well as describing how this research differs from your dissertation research--> 
I am committed to remaining an active scientist despite challenges of chronic illness.  The combination of computational, ecoinformatics, and quantitative skills is  a rare skill set among ecologists, and one that is particularly well suited to working remotely. Developing these skills further while engaging in remote collaborations with scientists at other institutions will provide a clear demonstration that telecommuting and remote collaboration should be a more accepted method for employment in the sciences, much as it is in the computer/tech fields.  

This paradigm shift supports not only scientists with disabilities/chronic illness, but also supports scientists who need to work remotely for a variety of reasons.  Increasing my computational, quantitative, and ecoinformatics skills will provide me with the maximum opportunity to continue performing research and collaborate with other scientists remotely, without formal institutional support if necessary.  

 
**Justification of sponsor(s) and host institution(s)**   
<!--5) a justification of the choice of sponsoring scientist(s) and host institution(s)-->
<!-- Description of awesome people with the skills and ideas that I want to work with-->
*Timothée Poisot (University of Montreal)-computational ecology & James O'Dwyer (University of Illinois)-theoretical ecology*  
Poisot's and O'Dwyer's research interests and skills make them ideal sponsors for both the intellectual development and implementation of this project.  **Poisot** is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences and is a member of the Quebec Centre for Biodiversity Science.  He is a strong advocate for open and reproducible science and his lab is heavily involved in creating well designed software for ecological analyses.  In addition, the University of Montreal has extensive remotely accessible computational resources and offers webinar training for using the high-performance computing resources.**O'Dwyer** is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Plant Biology.  He is a highly quantitative theoretical ecologist who also possess a high degree of computational skills.

I am a chronically ill/disabled scientist, and the nature of my condition requires me to work remotely.  Due to my physical limitations, I will be interacting with colleagues on-site through a remote presence via a Kubi teleconferencing robot (https://www.revolverobotics.com/), which will allow me to have control over my movement on site, leading to more natural interactions with my sponsors and lab mates.  In addition to their scientific expertise, Poisot and O'Dwyer are ideal sponsors as they are already experienced and comfortable with the computational tools and remote workflow  the tools that I need to collaborate with them, thus relieving me of the need to train my sponsors in the tools I need to use to work with them effectively.

**Broader impacts**  
<!--7)a separate section within the narrative, a discussion of the broader impacts of the proposed activities.-->
<!--Inadequacy of current efforts to include chronically ill researchers.-->
**Overview**  
Structural inequalities are the main barrier to participation by under-represented groups.  Working to improve opportunities and address structural inequalities to broaden participation for under-represented groups is, unfortunately part of being a member of an under-represented group or groups.  Having to self-advocate to improve structural inequalities and to obtain access as a member of an under-represented group is a frustrating and time-consuming activity that causes many people to select areas that have less structural barriers. While many people belong to more than one category of under-represented group,one category of under-representation that is frequently overlooked is people with chronic illness/disabilities.

I propose to address structural inequalities and barriers to participation for people with chronic illness/disabilities using currently existing tools and technology to **1)** reduce structural inequalities/barriers through education and **2** broadening participation through tools and technology.


**Reducing structural inequalities/barriers through education**   
Misconceptions and a lack of familiarty about disabilites and the nature of disability means that accessibility accommodations tend to be post-hoc, and cause the vast majority of current efforts to provide accessibility to chronically ill/disabled people in science to be inadequate or non-existent.  Educating people about the different types of disability and persuading people to provide accommodations without request for workshops, conferences, and for regular coursework will reduce the structural inequalities/barriers associated with being a person with a chronic illness disability.  Providing these accommodations in advance also helps individuals who could benefit from the accommodations for other situations (e.g., pregnancy, undergraduate working through college, caretakers of family members, people with temporary disabilities, etc.)  

I will work with the Ecological Society of America Early Career, Open Science, and Inclusive Ecology sections to create open access webinars and templates to educate people about how to reduce structural inequalities by making accommodations available before they are needed and publicizing that fact.  In addition, I have been active, and will continue my efforts, to bring awareness to structural inequalities and barriers associated with being a scientist with a disability/chronic illness and providing solutions to include people with disabilities/chronic illness through blog posts, social media, developing tools to assist in integrating accessibility planning into workshops/events, and reaching out to organizations in my field. 

**Broadening participation through tools and technology** 
Computational tools and techniques becoming increasingly more important in science, and having the opportunity to learn these skills has, so far, been primarily restricted to in-person workshops, classes, or events at larger institutions, yet it is a powerful way for scientists who cannot participate in field work to pursue science.  At my urging, both the Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry organizations have made certain that disability accessibility for workshops are an essential part of workshop planning and available accommodations are included in workshop announcements.  

As a Software Carpentry/Data Carpentry instructor, I will work with both of these organizations to develop, test and teach remotely accessible workshops. Having remote accessibility means that scientists who are unable to travel due to financial, physical, or other limitations can still participate in learning the tools that they need to collaborate and remain competitive.  Remote options also allow scientists who cannot travel to participate in sharing their skills, and train the next generation of scientists.


Remote accessibility also provides options for mentoring potential future generations of scientists.  I will also serve as a mentor for K-12 students with a disability/chronic illness interested in pursuing a career in science through the AccessSTEM DO-IT program at the University of Washington, which facilitates an online mentoring program.
