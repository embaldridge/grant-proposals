**Project description**  
**Introduction**  
<!--Put in good title here on the theme of identifying organismally relevant spatial and temporal scales.-->

<!--1) a brief and informative introduction or background section-->
A central problem in ecology is the effect of spatial and temporal scales on the study of pattern-generating mechanisms (ecological processes)[@levin1992problem].  Identifying the scales that are organismally important across taxa is central to understanding the processes that structure an assemblage or an ecological community.  The influence of ecological processes changes with scale.  
  
<!--Put in figure-->
  
This project aims to address three major gaps in our ecological understanding of spatial and temporal scale.  I will be identifying relative scale (i.e., the spatial and temporal scales that are organismally relevant) and exploring the relationship between absolute and relative scale [sensu @meentemeyer1989geographical].
This project will also demonstrate the utility and viability of fully remote, reproducible scientific collaboration using computational and ecoinformatics approaches.


**Research objectives, methods, and significance**  
<!--2) a statement of research objectives, methods, and significance-->
**Objective 1**  
Determine which spatial and temporal scales are organismally relevant.  

**Objective 2**   
Identify the scales over which space-for-time substitutions can be made. 

**Objective 3**  
Identify strengths of ecological processes at different spatial and temporal scales.

**Methods** 
Data-driven approaches to ecological questions (ecoinformatics) require the use of computationally intensive methods, but have been an increasingly valuable tool for biodiversity/ecological research [@michener2012ecoinformatics].  Ecoinformatics/macroecological approaches use large quantities of ecological data, often aggregated from the literature or from large survey efforts to address ecological questions using a comparative statistical approach [@brown1995macroecology; @kelling2009data], allowing ecologists to address questions at broader spatial or temporal scales and for a greater range of taxa than possible with a traditional field experimental approach.  

Something about exploratory analysis and emergent statistical patterns.
Decomposition analysis  
Statistical modelling  

**Data**  
While there are challenges of using synthetic and publicly available datasets [see @reichman2011challenges], using a diverse array of publicly available datasets allows ecologists to leverage existing data to answer questions using a comparative approach.

I will use spatially and temporally explicit community abundance data covering a wide array of taxa.  Large, publicly available datasets include data for birds [@BBS], plants[@fia;@plantsurveys], plankton [@plankton], and microbial [@meyer2008metagenomics], as well as smaller datasets for other taxonomic groups [@MiscDB; etc.].
 
For objective one, I will also use datasets that provide information on organismally relevant parameters at different scales, such as dispersal distance, home range sizes, maximum longevity, generation times, and geographic range size.

Need for additional database.  Database of vertebrate home ranges contains a relatively small subset of vertebrate diversity.  I will compile additional home range data from the literature.  

**Analysis** 
While a comparative approach can be a powerful approach for addressing broad ecological questions, the data needed to address these types of questions does not lend itself well to traditional hypothetico-deductive methods [@blackburn2004method].  Rather, I will use an information-theoretic approach   to generate simulated communities based on theoretical models, and then compare the simulated data to the empiricial data to determine which theoretical models have the best empirical support.

**Objective 1:Determine which spatial and temporal scales are organismally relevant.**  
Ecology is the study of the distribution of organisms in relation to their environment, encompassing both spatial and temporal relationships.  Unification of spatial and temporal scaling relationships across taxa relative to an organism and the relative position in the ecological hierarchy (organism, population, community, etc.) will provide a framework for developing more accurate predictive models of ecological pattern and processes that are spatially/temporally explicit. 

**Objective 2 :Identify the scales over which space-for-time substitutions can be made.**     
Although space-for-time substitutions have been used in ecology with varying degrees of efficacy[@pickett1989space], there has been little work done on when space-for-time substitutions can be reasonably used, and over what scales, if any, the relationship between space and time is reliable.

**Objective 3:Identify strengths of ecological processes at different spatial and temporal scales.**    
The strength or impact of an ecological process is often scale dependent [@levin1992problem].  Understanding how process strength changes with both spatial and temporal scale will allow for greater accuracy in developing spatially and temporally explict process-based models.

**Training objectives**    
Training in ecological software development and spatial and temporal analytical techniques will complement and increase my current skill set and areas of expertise.  My doctoral research focused on using maximum likelihood methods with Python programming to test competing models of species abundance distributions.  I have limited experience with spatial and temporal analysis or programming in R, the primary statistical programming language used by ecologists.  This project would give me strong training in temporal and spatial analysis, experience in developing software in a programming language (R), and experience with a wide variety of data  that will make it easier for me to work as a research scientist through developing my skills in programming, statistics, and ecoinformatics.  I will receive training in these skills through textbooks, computational resources, and mentoring.     

**Future directions/career development**  
<!--3) training objectives and plan for achieving them (these may include scientific as well as other career preparation activities)-->
Despite challenges of chronic illness, I am able to remain an active researcher through computational tools that allow me to perform research and collaborate with other scientists remotely.  Besides contributing to the scientific process through research, I have been working and will continue to work to increase accessibility and awareness for chronically ill/disabled ecologists and ecologists from other under-represented groups. 

**Career development**  
<!--4) an explanation of how the fellowship activities will enhance your career development and future research directions as well as describing how this research differs from your dissertation research-->

The combination of computational, ecoinformatics, and quantitative skills is  a rare skill set among ecologists, and one that is particularly well suited to working remotely.  Developing these skills further while engaging in remote collaborations with scientists at other institutions will provide a clear demonstration that telecommuting and remote collaboration should be a more accepted method for employment in the sciences, much as it is in the computer/tech fields.  This paradigm shift supports not only scientists with disabilities/chronic illness, but also scientists who are unable to attend events in person for a variety of reasons.  In addition, developing these skills also provides a way for me to continue doing science without formal institutional support if necessary.

<!-- Description of awesome people with the skills and ideas that I want to work with-->
*Timoth√©e Poisot (University of Montreal)-computational ecology*  
Poisot's research interests and skills make him an ideas sponsor for both the intellectual development and implementation of this project as well as an excellent mentor for developing and refining the computational skills that are an essential component of my training objectives.  **Poisot** is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences and is a member of the Quebec Centre for Biodiversity Science.  He is a strong advocate for open and reproducible science and his lab is heavily involved in creating well designed software for ecological analyses.  In additional to Poisot's computational expertise that will facilitate remote mentorship, the University of Montreal has extensive remotely accessible computational resources and offers webinar training for using the high-performance computing resources.

<!--Final paragraph-->Due to my physical limitations, I will not be able to be physically present at the host institutions; however, I will be able to interact with colleagues on-site through a remote presence via a Kubi teleconferencing robot (https://www.revolverobotics.com/), which will allow me to have control over my movement on site, leading to more natural interactions.  Additionally, all the sponsoring scientists are well-versed in the computational tools and workflow that make it possible for me to effectively collaborate with others remotely.

**Broader impacts**  
<!--7)a separate section within the narrative, a discussion of the broader impacts of the proposed activities.-->
<!--Inadequacy of current efforts to include chronically ill researchers.-->
**Overview**  
Working to improve opportunities and address structural inequalities to broaden participation for under-represented groups is, unfortunately part of being a member of an under-represented group or groups.  Having to self-advocate to improve structural inequalities and to obtain access as a member of an under-represented group robs researchers of valuable and limited time and energy that they could spend doing science, and many scientists belong to more than one category of under-represented group. One category of under-representation that is frequently overlooked is scientists who are facing short or long-term disability due to health conditions, either mental or physical.

A lack of familiarity with disability/chronic illness means that accessibility accommodations tend to be post-hoc, and cause the vast majority of current efforts to provide accessibility to chronically ill/disabled scientists to be inadequate or non-existent. I have been active in bringing awareness to problems associated with being a scientist with a disability/chronic illness and providing solutions to include scientists with disabilities/chronic illness through blog posts, social media, and reaching out to organizations in my field.  I propose to use currently existing tools and technology to improve access for many categories of under-represented group through creating a framework for remote access tools for collaboration as well as remote options for learning to use those tools.  

Remote scientific collaborations have been a way to facilitate participation by under-represented groups for a long time ( for example, women corresponding with male scientists through letters, only using their first initial).  Having a better framework to guide remote collaboration and participation can increase participation for scientists with disability/chronic illness, scientists from primarily undergraduate institutions, and scientists who lack the means to travel. Remote options are also available for mentoring chronically ill/disabled students who are interested in science. I will also become involved with the AccessSTEM DO-IT (Disabilities, Opportunities, Internetworking, and Technology) program at the University of Washington as a mentor for disabled K-12 students interested in pursuing a career in a STEM field. 

**Broadening participation through tools and technology**  
Open science is also a powerful tool for increasing the accessibility of science for many different underrepresented groups, not only chronically ill/disabled researchers.  For example, people at primarily undergraduate institutions or who are unaffiliated with an institution often lack access to the funding and resources that larger institutions have.  An open approach to science allows access and sharing of educational tools and lessons, data, and papers that would be difficult or impossible to acquire otherwise.  Remote work, combined with open science approaches helps to equalize the conditions for primarily undergraduate institutions and researchers doing computational work, allowing them to remain more competitive with researchers at larger institutions, as well as create opportunities for communicating science to under-represented groups at the K-12 levels through developing lessons and outreach tools.

<!--Plan for teaching these skills.-->
Computational tools and techniques becoming increasingly more important in science, and having the opportunity to learn these skills has, so far, been primarily restricted to in-person workshops, classes, or events at larger institutions.  At my urging, both the Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry organizations plan to develop and provide remote accessibility to workshops, as well as making certain that disability accessibility for workshops are an essential part of workshop planning and available accommodations are included in workshop announcements.  Having remote accessibility means that scientists who are unable to travel due to financial, physical, or other limitations can still participate in learning the tools that they need to collaborate and remain competitive.  Remote options also allow scientists who cannot travel to participate in sharing their skills, and train the next generation of scientists.
