Prepare Project Summary (also called Abstract) of Proposed Research and Training. [1 page limit]
 This is an abstract of the proposed research and training. You must
clearly address and identify in separate statements using the three boxes:(1) an overview of the project;(2) the intellectual merit of the proposed activity; and (3) the broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity or the application will be returned without review.
For all areas, list your sponsoring scientist(s) and institution(s) in the overview.

#Project summary
##Research overview
The ultimate goal of my research is to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms that produce commonness and rarity in
an ecological context. First, I will explore the evolutionary basis of commonness and rarity by determining if commonness and rarity are
phylogenetically heritable. Second, I will identify if regional occupancy and abundance can be explained by life history traits. <!--Or: Understanding the spatial and temporal scales that are relevant to organisms could provide a better guide for the spatial and temporal scale a study needs to identify mechanisms affecting species richness and abundance for those taxa.  It may also be possible to identify a general pattern for how space and time relationships change with taxa.-->

##Intellectual 
While the hollow curve species abundance distribution is a ubiquitious macroecological pattern, attempting to identify mechanisms of commonness and rarity through model fitting has been unsuccessful.  Recent research suggests that examining crucial constraints that produce the pattern is a more effective approach to identify mechanism.  <!--Something about S and N and interesting which species are likely to be more abundant, conservation, utility of trait based approaches + phylogeny over multiple taxa. --> <!--Different ecological mechanisms operate at different scales, and thus the scale at which a study is conducted is central to understanding those mechanisms.  While ecology has addressed the problems of spatial scale for some time now, it has been only recently that the data have become available to address the problem of temporal scale, although space-for-time substitutions are fairly common.  Because temporal scale ecology is still in its infancy, the problem of synthesizing the relationship between space and scale has not yet been thoroughly addressed, but is central to understanding over which scales space-for-time substitutions are effective, and the relative importance of space and time in identifying pattern generating ecological mechanisms.-->

##Broader impacts
A lack of familiarity with disability/chronic illness means that accessibility accommodations tend to be post-hoc, and cause the vast majority of current efforts to provide accessibility to chronically ill/disabled scientists to be inadequate or non-existent. I have been active in bringing awareness to both the problems associated with being a scientist with disability/chronic illness as well as providing solutions to include scientists with disabilities/chronic illness through blog posts and social media, and I will continue those efforts.  In addition, I will increase accessibility for scientists by working with Data Carpentry to provide remote access to Data Carpentry workshops. Remote access will allow scientists who need to attend remotely to be able to attend and learn skills that provide a more efficient workflow as well as facilitating remote research and collaboration.  These skills can make it possible/easier for a chronically ill researcher to remain an active scientist.  I will also work/ continue working to start and propose inititives for an Ecological Society of America Inclusive Ecology section. which will provide an intersectional group to encompass all under-represented groups in ecology.  The Inclusive Ecology section will form alliances with other Ecological Society of American sections, create training materials, and provide workshops and mentoring programs to address systemic inequalities in ecology and improve retention and provide support for under-represented groups in ecology.<!-- This may need to move down, and the other broader impacts section may need to move up.  Either way, the broader impacts needs quite a bit of work and focusing.-->

#Project Description

##Research objectives, methods, and significance


##Future directions/career development
Independent researcher  
I have a chronic illness which has seriously impacted my ability to function in the traditional academic environment.  Travel to conferences or workshops is extremely challenging, and for the majority of events, no longer an option due to the severe health consequences that  remain as the aftereffects of travel for several weeks afterwards.  My condition has caused periods of cognitive dysfunction related to information processing and comprehension as well as periods of reliance on mobility assistance devices.  <!-- I really don't know how much to disclose.  My inclination is to gloss over it personally, but I think from a cultural changing perspective that it could be valuable to fully disclose to indicate that I've got some really significant problems but am still doing research anyway -->  Despite these challenging, I am able to remain an active researcher through a series of coping mechanism.  Besides contributing to the scientific process through research, I have been working and will continue to work to increase accessibility and awareness for chronically ill/disabled ecologists and ecologists from other under-represented groups. 

Career development
Computational ecology skills, combined with data wrangling skills and open access data provide a way for me to continue doing science without institutional support.  Working with Data and Software Carpentry to help spread the skills gives me a larger pool of potential collaborators, plus it allows me to be able to teach.


##Justification of sponsor(s) and host institution(s)

##Goals and benchmarks
I think I got the data wrangling bit done.

<!--Need to learn phylogenetic analysis-->

Write more scripts, do things.

Learn more spatial analysis techniques.

Learn temporal analysis techniques.

I want to continue to improve my scientific programming skills.

##Broader impacts
<!--Inadequacy of current efforts to include chronically ill researchers.-->
A chronically ill researcher is working with less energy, and less physical capacity than an able bodied scientist.  While dealing with a failing body, a scientist should not also have to fight the numerous institutional barriers to remaining an active participant in science.  Having to self-advocate for access robs the researchers of valuable and limited time and energy that he/she could use to be actually doing science.  Many workshops/conferences lack any accessibility information, and the accessibility information that is available is often restricted to the more traditionally visible disability (vision/hearing impairment, mobility restrictions) and buried on the organizational website, rather than being provided in the announcement.  Providing remote access/attendance is a way that chronically ill/ disabled scientists can attend workshops and conferences that allow them to remain current on cutting edge research and techniques in their field.


<!--Tools that a chronically ill researcher can use to remain active in the field. -->
As a chronically ill researcher, I have found that computational tools have been invaluable in allowing me to continue working as an active researcher.  Not only do these skills make remote collaboration much easier/possible, these tools also make executing research much easier.  
Version control
Programming
Database skills


<!--Plan for teaching these skills.-->
I have been working with Ethan White with Data Carpentry to provide remote accessibility to workshops, as well as making certain that disability accessibility for workshops are part of the announcement.

I have also written a simple Python script to generate a sample disability accessibility statement for workshops/conferences.

I have also been active in disclosing my illness and trying to raise awareness about chronically ill/disabled researchers.
