Research in the lab is currently supported by a NSERC Discovery grant (26kCAD a year, 2015-2019), a FRQNT Early career investigator grant (16kCAD a year, 2015-2016), and a starting grant from the Université de Montréal (25kCAD, 2015-2018). We benefit from a computational ressource allocation of 260 core-years on Compute Québec supercomputers, which is shared among group members. Additional in-house computing resources are available through a hardware grant from Nvidia (2056 CUDA cores for GP-GPU computing), and through a FRQNT Equipment award (48 Intel Xeon cores for parallel computing).

Additional ad-hoc support is available through the Québec Centre for Biodiversity Sciences, and through the Faculty for Graduate and Post-Doctoral Studies of the Université de Montréal.
