# Ongoing research projects in the host group

> A brief description of the research projects in the host research group(s) along with a description of how the research and training plan for the applicant would fit into and complement ongoing research of the sponsor(s)  and an indication of the personnel with whom the Fellow would work.

Research in the group (*Laboratoire d'Écologie Quantitiative & Computationelle*) focuses on the variability of species interactions over time, space, and organisational scales. Key ongoing projects include linking the structure of ecological networks to ecosystem properties, understanding the role of local adaptation on the structure of communities in varying environments, and finding environmental drivers of the variation of species interactions. An emerging line of research deals with teasing out the effects of species traits, species abundance, local environment, and random chance on variations in the structure of ecological networks. Dr. Baldrige's research project will complement this axis of investigation nicely; we have a common focus on the role of body size distribution in community structure and responses.

The research we do in the lab is embedded in several large scale collaborative efforts, aiming notably to use open ecological data to accelerate synthesis research. The Université de Montréal, through its Center for Biodiversity, the Québec Centre for Biodiversity Sciences, and the Compute Canada consortium, has access to high-availability, high-performance computing resources, and free on-demand consulting with programmers, analysts, algorithmicians, and data managers. The Department of Biological Sciences has a research group in Quantitative Biology formed by seven professors, including Poisot, whith a focus on the development and implementation of new quantitative tools for ecological sciences.

# Current and pending research support

> A statement of current and pending research support, both private and public, for each 
sponsor. If any sponsor has submitted similar research for funding, the degree of overlap must 
be addressed.

## Poisot

Research in the lab is currently supported by a NSERC Discovery grant (26k CAD a year, 2015-2019), a FRQNT Early career investigator grant (16k CAD a year, 2015-2016), and a starting grant from the Université de Montréal (25k CAD, 2015-2018). We benefit from a computational ressource allocation of 260 core-years on Compute Québec supercomputers, which is shared among group members. Additional in-house computing resources are available through a hardware grant from NVidia (2056 CUDA cores for GP-GPU computing), and through a FRQNT Equipment award (48 Intel Xeon cores for parallel computing). Additional ad-hoc support is available through the Québec Centre for Biodiversity Sciences, and through the Faculty for Graduate and Post-Doctoral Studies of the Université de Montréal.

Pending support includes a Sloan Research Fellowship (55k USD for two years; submitted); a Simons Foundation targeted grant (200k USD yearly, for three years; letter of intent submitted); a Canadian Foundation for Innovation cyberinfrastructure group proposal (3M CAD for five years; submitted); a Canadia Foundation for Innovation Leadership single investigator award (100k CAD; submitted); a CIEE working group award (14k CAD; submitted).

# Specific mentoring plan

> An explanation of how the sp
onsor(s) will determine what mentoring the applicant needs in 
research, teaching, and career development skills and how these would be translated into a 
specific plan that fosters the development of the applicant's future independent research 
career.

Dr. Baldrige has an established track record of producing independant research of the highest quality, as well as a recognized implication in the ecological community. As such, there is no doubt that she is already an independant investigator in her own right. Keeping this in mind informed the type of mentoring that we will provide. Specifically, we will

1. Identify a list of desired skills, computationals and quantitative, and select training opportunities at either sponsor's institution, that Dr. Baldrige will be able to attend remotely. There are, for example, high-quality online courses in quantitative ecology and complexity sciences (such as the one organized by the *Santa Fe Institute*).
2. Identify networking abilities, such as possible working groups in which Dr. Baldrige can make a contribution, as well as informal mentoring by other colleagues that can contribute to the project.
3. Identify possibilities for professional growth, such as opportunities to assume leadership roles. It must be noted, however, that Dr. Baldrige *already* demonstrated her ability as a leader in her field, by (i) iniating, and succesfully creating, the *Inclusive ecology* section of the Ecological Society of America, and (ii) taking the role of communication officer in the *Open Science* section of the same society. 


# Role of the sponsor in research

> A  description of the role the sponsor(s) will play in the proposed research and training and the 
other resources that will be available to the Fellow to complete his or her training plan during 
the fellowship.


# Description of limitations

> A description of the limitations, if any
,
that will
be placed on the Fellow regarding the 
research following
the conclusion of
the fellowship

We anticipate that all research objects produced during the funding period will be released under licenses compliant with open science best practices (FOSS software packages, CC-BY preprints and/or publications, ...). The fellow will be identified as the primary producer of all products. This licensing choice will allow the fellow, and indeed everyone, to re-use all of the research that will be produced.
